        <h2>Season 2 - Story Overview</h2>
        <p>
            In Season 2 of *Scissor Seven*, Seven dives deeper into the world of assassins, and his forgotten past begins to catch up with him. He’s now 
            targeted by other skilled assassins who see him as a threat. With his growing abilities, Seven’s scissor-wielding skills and shape-shifting 
            powers improve, allowing him to take on tougher missions.
        </p>
        <p>
            This season also explores Seven’s friendships and alliances. He continues his friendship with Dai Bo, but new characters, like the assassin 
            Redtooth, complicate his life and add layers to the story. Seven’s bond with Thirteen deepens as she becomes a more trusted ally, and we learn 
            more about her tragic background and her connection to Seven.
        </p>
        <p>
            The season reaches a peak when Seven faces the challenges of his own powers and wrestles with conflicting emotions about his past. The 
            intense battles, dramatic reveals, and character development make Season 2 a turning point for Seven’s journey and lay the groundwork for the 
            next season.
