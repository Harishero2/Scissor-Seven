        <h2>Season 1 - Story Overview</h2>
        <p>
            *Scissor Seven* Season 1 introduces us to Seven, a scissor-wielding assassin who, due to amnesia, is struggling to remember his past. 
            Though he works as an assassin to make money, Seven is far from typical. With a kind-hearted personality and a habit of messing up his missions, 
            he often finds himself in comedic situations that contrast with the dark world of assassins. Seven’s goal is simple: to earn enough money to 
            undergo an operation to restore his lost memories.

            Living on Chicken Island, Seven takes on various jobs, most of which turn into bizarre adventures. Despite his aim to complete his missions 
            efficiently, he ends up befriending or helping many of his targets instead. Throughout Season 1, Seven learns about his assassin past as he 
            clashes with other assassins and dangerous foes. His abilities, like his skill with scissors and shape-shifting powers, become central to the 
            series' action scenes. Even though he works as a hitman, his reluctance to kill often leads to humorous outcomes.

            Season 1 also introduces some important characters, such as Dai Bo, his bird manager and friend, who pushes him to complete jobs for income. 
            Chairman Jiang, the leader of Chicken Island, provides guidance and occasionally steps in to help. As the season progresses, Seven encounters 
            Thirteen, a talented assassin who initially poses a threat but later becomes an ally and friend, adding a layer of intrigue to his journey.

            The finale of Season 1 leaves audiences with hints about Seven’s mysterious past and his potential as a powerful fighter. Though he seems 
            lighthearted and clumsy, there is a serious side to his character, suggesting a darker and more complex history that is yet to be fully revealed.
            Season 1 combines humor, action, and heartwarming moments, making *Scissor Seven* a unique blend of comedy and drama.
