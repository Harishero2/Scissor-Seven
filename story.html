        <h2>Scissor Seven - Story Overview</h2>
        <p>
            *Scissor Seven* is a Chinese animated series that follows the story of Seven, a quirky, scissor-wielding assassin
            with amnesia. His goal is to recover his lost memories while undertaking odd jobs and missions on Chicken Island.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although Seven works as an assassin, his kind-hearted nature and unusual approach often get him into comedic
            situations. As he dives deeper into the assassin world, he learns more about his mysterious past.
